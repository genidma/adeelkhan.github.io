It's interesting to note that there were still oceans on the surface of the earth during the Hadean eon. Inspite of the fact that the average surface temperature was way past the temperature at which water boils/evaporates. This was possible because of there was a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. This would have resulted into more atmospheric pressure. And thus enabling conditions via which liquid water could exist. Even in that the super hot environment.
