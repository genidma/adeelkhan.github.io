During October (2020), I came across the following two gems via Youtube. 

|  Name and URL | What is this video about  |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| [Arctic -  Underwater Aliens Documentary via Science Channel](https://youtu.be/Bh1sZ2UoaUk) |Strange and exotic lifeforms (in a real sense) of the [White Sea in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sea) | 
| [LIFE BEYOND II: The Museum of Alien Life (4K)](https://youtu.be/ThDYazipjSI) via [MelodySheep](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9sFzaG9Ia_kXJhfxtFMBA) | An wonderfully put together imaginative slice of what life could look like in the wider universe| 

Enjoy!
