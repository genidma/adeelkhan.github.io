The first eon on Earth was the Hadean. This era lasted for about 600 million years. This was the time when the moon collided with earth. During this era, the average surface temperature was in the range of '230 °C (446 °F)'

Here is an artist's representation of what conditions may have been like on the earth's surface. Please note, these are not my images and I found them on the web (creative commons license).
