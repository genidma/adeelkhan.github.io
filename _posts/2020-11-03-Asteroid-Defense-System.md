Yesterday, the following two movies came up in my feed. 

First up was the movie by the title of . . 

The second movie/documentary is a Germany-American production titled 

|  Movie  | Release Date  | Storyline | Other Notes | 
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [The Day After](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085404/) |1983| Soviet and American nukes go off. The devastating effects are witnessed, focusing on a small town in Eastern Kansas. | Starring familiar faces like [John Lithgow](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001475/). In particular, I remember watching Lithgow on [Harry and the Hendersons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093148/), which was a pretty cool and entertaining tv show. Also, [Steve Guttenberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000430/?ref_=tt_cl_t3) whom I recall from movies like [Three men and a baby](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094137/?ref_=nm_knf_t1) and the hilarious [Police Academy Franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Academy_(franchise)). I had never seen Steve Guttenberg doing such a serious role before. | 
| [Super Comet : After the Impact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1273815/) | 2007| A [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet) travelling at a super high speed, smacks earth near the Yucatan peninsula. I think, this documentary is actually hypothesizing, what were to happen if an event like [Chicxulub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) were to happen again.   | Please see below |
