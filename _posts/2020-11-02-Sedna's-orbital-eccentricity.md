After publishing the [previous blogpost](https://stellardreams.github.io/Grape-fruit-sized-Black-Hole-in-the-outer-solar-system/), I started looking into the orbits of some of the other objects in the [Trans-Neptunian System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object). These objects are referred to as TNO's. (Trans Neptunian Objects)

I wasn't very familiar with what's really out there in this outer solar system region. First, I googled [Sedna's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna) orbit. Sedna's [orbital eccentricty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity) is quite high. It's orbit is a lot more elliptical. Compared to the somewhat circular (not as elliptical) orbits from Mercury to Pluto.

Most of the planetary bodies in the in the inner solar system have a [much lower orbital eccentricity](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/). With the exception of Mercury in the inner solar system. And Pluto (downgraded to a dwarf planet) in the outer solar system.  Even then, there's an order of magnitude of a difference when you compare Mercury or Pluto's orbital eccentriciy to Sedna or the other TNOs   

|  Object  | Orbital Eccentricity  |
| :------------- | :-------------: |
| `Mercury` |0.2056| 
| `Venus` |0.0068| 
| `Earth` |0.0167| 
| `Mars` |0.0934| 
| `Jupiter` |0.0484| 
| `Saturn` |0.0542| 
| `Uranus` |0.0472|
| `Neptune` |0.0086|
| `Pluto` |0.2488| 
| `Sedna` |**0.84259**| 

* In fact, if you go to the following page on Wikipedia [Extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_trans-Neptunian_object#Outer_Solar_System_Origins_Survey) and scroll down just a bit to the table. Then, you will see that all of the objects have a very high rate of orbital eccentricity.

The questions that I am thinking of:
* To begin ith, why are the orbits of TNOs so elliptical?
* There must be a relation with regards to the mass of an object and the gravitational pull acting upon. 
* Why doesn't Sedna and all of these other TNOs get ejected from the solar system?
* If Sedna/TNOs are in more than one orbit? For example, orbit around the sun and then orbiting around a black-hole?
* If Sedna/TNOs are indeed in more than one orbit, then there must be a clever way to figure this out. There must be a change, a dip in their orbit as it swaps from being in the gravitational hold of one object to another. 
* As Sedna/TNOs swap orbits, there must be fluctuations in it's velocity. These fluctations could then be measured. Perhaps by on-board instrumentation. The problem is that these orbits are long. For example, Sedna's orbit around the sun is 11,408 years. 

Overall: So far there is no evidence that Planet X exists. There have been other theories that have been put forth. For example, this theory that I just read about, a collection of icy bodies making a disc of sorts. [link](https://medium.com/predict/planet-nine-ruled-out-as-the-cause-of-outer-solar-system-mystery-orbits-9846266bd073)

My uneducated and intuitive guess is that the theory of an actual black-hole in the outer solar system makes more sense.
