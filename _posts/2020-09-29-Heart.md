Good ideas can come from anywhere. And there is good talent that can be found virtually in any given part of the world. 

I believe that each one of us is capable of achieving greatness. 

I think that four of the central tenets of achieving greatness are (amongst others) and in random order:

* Putting in consistent and measurable effort towards a cause or causes. Not too many though, as focus is finite. 
* Cultivating good habits and being kind to oneself in the process of doing so.
* Learning to delay gratification. This is something you can learn, as neuroplasticity exists. But you have to move your limbs or not move them and take actions in order to rewire your brain. 
* Go into areas that you are curious about. To do the things that you enjoy doing. And figure out how to make money, doing more of that. 

There are going to be ups and downs in life. There are things that are in our control and then there are things that we have influence over. 

I do not know much about Antoine de Saint-Exupery. But there appears to be a lot of wisdom in this quote by him:

"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Also, I am reminded of the following quote. I am not sure about the source of this quote. "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
