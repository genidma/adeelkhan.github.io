This year I identified five areas that should be the area of focus for me. Historically speaking, I have spent a lot of time working in the technology industry. And so it would not a surprise that I wanted to enable:
- Mechanisms via which we could enable newer constructs for enabling computation. There is a platform component to it and then there is the human computer interaction to it. This is a very rich and super interesting area.
- I also love big/mega projects. Projects which could demonstrably help improve our lives in a quality sense. 

But then I meditated on my visions and goals a bit. And I looked at this list of 60 or so goals that I had set. Then I thought about the past 7 years and how I have only been a weekend dad. Meaning, a dad that is only available every other weekend. Not every weekend. 

Then it started to hit me. I was working very hard to create a better future at the expense of not being here in the present. Plus, the quality of my life/living conditions is not very good and has not been very good. 

This is completely my fault. 

Plus, there were a lot of things that I had to change and this change in the wider domain of habit formation and neuroplasticity, takes time. 

So after this longer period of introspection, I decided to: 
- Redirect a majority of my activity towards becoming a better person (in a quantified sense). As well, as work towards becoming a better parent. A parent who is aware and present everyday. A parent who is there. 
- Thinking about enabling outer space/newer realities is something I love doing. We are going to open up outer space. We are going to have gardens, tourists going to off-world habitats within 15 years (or less). Outer space is going to power the majority of growth for the forseeable future. There are going to be enough resources available to help support all the needs of every human in a completely sustainable way. But we should also and already be thinking of making the leap to the next star system in a safe and ethical sense. What if we find life on other exoplanets? What will we do in such a situation? As well, how will we choose to be, in a world where all sorts of complex and intricate patterns can be recreated. Including our mind or minds. 

I guess a lot of things come down to, how you lived and how you treated yourself and others. Steve Jobs used to refer to this as poison. The negativity that is in the construct. People being mean to each other. As well, being unconscious and hurting themselves in the process of doing so. We have all been susceptible to this poison, at some point in our lives. 

Overall, I narrowed down the 60 goals to 2 goals. But there are two areas in particular, where if we do a good job. The gains could be unbelievably spectacular! On the flip side, if these systems go wrong or start going in a destructive direction then it could also be very bad. Here are these very two areas.  
- Harnessing the collective power of the crowds in order to solve the bigger set of problems. Historically speaking, I have spent a bit of a time thinking about this. Feel free to check out my Youtube page [@adeelnkhan](https://www.youtube.com/user/adeelnkhan/videos) and let me know if there is anything on there that piques your interest. And/or any questions that you have. In particular and if you are reading this, then I would encourage you to check out the video by the title of ['Idea : Dynamic Scalability of Teams v 1.0'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8NHGNadIhg)
- I have reason to believe that we are going to see breakthroughs in multiple domains in the next 15 years. Scientific discovery is a global endeavour and scientific discovery has been powered primarily by taxpayers. Access to these resources should be made available in a democratic manner vs a handful of people having access to radical/truly transformative technology. 

With that being said, these two areas are now yours to think about and develop upon. 

Deep down inside, we already know what is good and wholesome in a universal sense. And a lot of it has to do with bringing about changes related to oneself. 

If you are taking consistent steps towards changing yourself, then you are changing the universe. And that, my friends is powerful. 

To adventure & fellowship! With enthusiasm & gusto!
