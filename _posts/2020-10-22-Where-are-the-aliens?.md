Estimates from the year 2018 indicate that we have [Two Trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=two+trillion) galaxies in this universe.

That's 2 to the 12th power. 

[Lord Rees of Ludlow - Lord Martin Rees](https://royalsociety.org/people/martin-rees-12156/) has this theory that the universe could be more expansive. The analogy he makes use of is to think of a ship that goes out of sight, across the horizon. I am not going to be able to do justice here and I forget the exact source here. But, I believe the reasoning was that the universe may be more expansive that we assume it to be. And if so, there could be a lot more galaxies out there. This assumption seems valid, because we haven't really been able to detect [the edge of the universe](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that,about%206%20billion%20trillion%20miles). If there is even an edge.

That being said, this is just an assumption at this point in time. Claims require evidence. 

The other point is that we have barely started to begin peering out into the wider universe. We know a lot more, since the release of [Hubble](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html) and yet we haven't even scratched the surface of what could be out there. 

As one can appreciate, we do not really know the actual number of real-estate (given number of galaxies, stars or planets) across this universe. And so we make informed and educated guesses, whereby these probabilities are backed up with some evidence that we have collected. However, it seems to be, the more instruments we put out there, the more we uncover. As well, considering the enormous amount of time that the universe has existed for and considering the fact that it's only been a couple of decades since we start peering outwards in a systematic manner. I'd say that our journey has barely begun. 

The actual purpose of this blogpost is to begin to think about the kind of questions that start emerging in my mind (and definitely not to sound all that), when I think of Fermi's paradox (link later below). And I should have probably clarified this earlier on. But, in terms of the components of this particular blogpost: 1) I share some of the numbers that we are aware of today. 2) Next, there is a brief mention of Frank Drake's equation. and 3) Finally, I get into the Fermi paradox side of things. It was really the thoughts specific to Fermi's paradox, that led me to write this blogpost in the first place. 

Let's go back to what I started with (numbers).Wikipedia cites that there are anywhere from 100 to 400 Billion stars across the Milky way (The Galaxy that our solar system is a part of) [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). According to the European Space Agency (ESA), there are anywhere from 100 Billion to 1 Trillion stars in the Milky Way. 10 to the power 11/12. [Source](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe)

The same article via ESA (link above) cites that the total number of planets across the universe could be anywhere from [10 sextillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ten+to+the+power+22) (10 to the power 22) to [1 Septillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ten+to+the+power+24) (10 to the power 24)

So suffice to say there are a lot of stars. And each one of these stars, have (at the very least) one or two planets going around it/them.

Next, about two years ago I made the following video [link](https://youtu.be/2kcHGNa6vRs) about [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation). You don't have to review the video. I mean, I tried to break it down so that my daughter (who was in grade 3 at the time) could understand it. Also, I made that video in order to start understanding how the probabilities have been documented. The mechanism is fairly straightforward. And given the set of variables, you multiply the various probabilities together. By the way, there is this interactive tool that is available on BBC's website, whereby you can tweak different elements of the equation. [Source](http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/drake)

If we focus on the prospect of finding life and then intelligent life across this Galaxy that we are a part of (The Milky Way). So, we are looking at anywhere from 100 to 400 Billion stars. So, 200 to 800 Billion planets. Again, I think the actual figure could be a lot more. 

`The question is, with the higher estimate being shy of the 1 trillion planet mark across the Milky Way. Why is it that we haven't noticed any observable signs for intelligent life.`

So this is where the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) kicks in. If the probabilities could/do indicate that there must be a x number of intelligent civilizations out there, beaming some kind of a signal across the Galaxy and the wider universe at that. Then where are these beings? Where are the signals? (Other than that one time - [the wow signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal)) Where are the [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere), [ringworlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld) and other mega structures?

Yes, we have barely started looking. But, so far there isn't any observable sign that would indicate the presence of an advance/somewhat intelligent civilization leaving behind some kind of a marker for it's existence, anywhere across the galaxy or the wider universe at that. 

Next, this is not a novel thought, but the Fermi paradox also applies to dimensions of time. If there are time travellers amongst us, then where are they? I'd think that it will be substantially a lot more tricker to spot a time traveller than it will be to spot a mega structure, a gas signature around a planet (Seager's equation), communication patterns that are being beamed all over the place (But we just can't dial into the right frequency) and a lot more. 

And so, we go back to the title of the blogpost. Where are the [ALFs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090390/), [the E.Ts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/), [the Vulcans](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Vulcan), the Klingons, the Ferengi. Where are the [Nordic aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_aliens), the blue avians (If they do visit, what must they think about us devouring birds). 

Almost 24 years have passed and we've yet to make [contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/) or even come close to doing so. But, not unless you listen to folks like (including, but not limited to) and in random order:

- [Edgar Mitchell from the Apollo 14 mission](https://www.military.com/off-duty/navy-astronaut-and-6th-man-moon-believed-alien-intervention.html)
- Governor Jimmy Carter (At the time) Once [filed a report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter_UFO_incident), indicating that he and others had witnessed a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object). However, he later clarified his position (on Wolf Blitzer's segment on CNN) and indicated that he did not believe that this was an alien spacecraft. 
- [Dr. Steven M Greer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Greer) has done a fair bit of work in this space. It's been about a decade, since I looked him up again or the work that Mr. Greer has been doing. I did watch the original 'Disclosure project' and I remember watching at least two hours of testimonies by former military, intelligence and government officials. I think, this is a [link](https://siriusdisclosure.com/videos-on-demand/) to his website. I am not sure. I haven't had a chance to see any of the newer documentaries. (Since 2010 ish).
- [Paul Hellyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hellyer#Extraterrestrial_intelligence_claims) Extra-ordinary claims. However, no evidence has been presented (to date) in order to be able to back up the hypotheses.
