After I made my the previous blogpost, I started looking into the orbits of some of the other objects in the [Trans-Neptunian System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object). These objects are referred to as TNO's. (Trans Neptunian Objects)

I wasn't very familiar with what's really out there in this outer solar system region. The first object that I googled up was [Sedna's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna) orbit. Sedna's [orbital eccentricty] is quite high. Most of the planetary bodies in the in the inner solar system have a much lower orbital eccentricity. With the exception of Mercury in the inner solar system. And pluto (downgraded to a dwarf planet) in the outer solar system.     

Sedna's orbital eccentricity is higher. The orbit is a lot more elliptical, than it is circular.

The questions that I am thinking of:
* There must be a relation with regards to the mass of an object and the gravitational pull acting upon. 
* Why doesn't Sedna get ejected from the solar system?
* Is Sedna in more than one orbit? For example, orbit around the sun and then orbiting around a black-hole?
* If Sedna is indeed in more than one orbit, then there must be a clever way to figure this out. There must be a change, a dip in Sedna's orbit as it swaps from being in the gravitational hold of one object to another. 
* As well, as Sedna swaps orbits there must be fluctuations in it's velocity which would be measured. Perhaps by on-board instrumentation. The problem is that Sedna's orbit around the sun is 11,408 years. 

So far there is no evidence that Planet X exists. There have been other theories that have been put fort. For example, this theory that I just read about, a collection of icy bodies making a disc of sorts.

My uneducated and intuitive guess is that the theory of an actual black-hole in the outer solar system makes more sense. It looks like in addition to Sedna, there are a number of TNOs out there and their orbital eccentricity is much higher.
