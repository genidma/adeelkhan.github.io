Over the summer, the following news item caught my attention. 

[Planet Nine could be a grapefruit-sized black hole, say astrophysicists](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/planet-nine-could-be-a-grapefruit-sized-black-hole-say-astrophysicists/)

* First of all, the title is misleading. Because no planetary body has been identified in the [Trans-Neptunian region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets_beyond_Neptune), something that can actually be categorized as a planet. Or a structure with the kind of gravitional pull that has been suspected. 
* That being said, if there is indeed a [Black Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#:~:text=A%20black%20hole%20is%20a,to%20form%20a%20black%20hole.) in a specific range. In such a scenario and given a particular (x) probability attached to this hypothetical event, we should be expending a lot more resources to figure out what this is and what could the implications could possibly be.

I think, when I use the words 'specific range', what I may be referring to is the [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#:~:text=The%20Schwarzschild%20radius%20(sometimes%20historically,of%20a%20Schwarzschild%20black%20hole.)

As of right now, there is a [small team of three individuals at Harvard](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2020-13) who have been looking into this. 

Now, if this object does have a, quote "mass of five to ten times that of the Earth.". What matters in this situation is:
* The actual orbit and trajectory of this thing. 
* The rate at which it is moving about it's orbit/trajectory. 
* Contingent upon what this thing really is (if it exists), how will it be impacting comets/asteroids/planets and maybe even the sun. If it were to come into contact with an entity in either one of these scales. I guess that's three different set of large scale simulation, whereby depending on the size comets and asteroids could be lumped into a single category.

Again, if this exists then the best case scenario would be that some comets and asteroids are disturbed and either just whiz around the solar system or are swallowed in. I actualy have no idea what I am talking about here. And so, when it comes to the worst case scenario, I have absolutely no idea what the gravitional pull of this object is really like. So, it's hard to extrapolate what the best and also worst case scenario may actually turn out to be. 

Next, I am assuming and from the perspective of our current technological development, I guess we aren't really sending probes inside this thing. Or even near x distance from it. 

But, if a black-hole of this scale is indeed in the outer solar system, then I'd think (from my uneducated perspective) that this is something that warrants a lot more attention.

Note: I got a sense of how far away the outer solar system is, when I was talking to [Iwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iwinmatthew) a couple of months ago. At that time, I kind of knew that in terms of light distance or speed of light, Neptune is a good 4 hours away from the sun. Roughly about the same time from earth, as it takes 8 minutes for sunlight to get to earth. In terms of actual distance, Earth is a 149 million km from the Sun. And Neptune is 4.49 **billion** kms from the sun. So do the math. This does go back to the questions I started with, what is the actual orbit and trajectory of this thing and the speed that it is moving at. 


Has anyone been looking into this in a bit more detail? Would love to learn more.
