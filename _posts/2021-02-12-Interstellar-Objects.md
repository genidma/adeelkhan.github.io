Last night I was reading up on [2I/Borisov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2I/Borisov). It's the second observed and documented [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) that has passed through our solar system.

Note: I am working on this blogpost at the moment. 12:35 Eastern.
