Last night I was reading up on [2I/Borisov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2I/Borisov). It's the second observed and documented [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) that has passed through our solar system.

[Oumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua) being the first. 

I've spent a little bit more time reading up on Oumuamua, so I will mostly write about this object. As well, the observation of Oumuamua has kickstarted a wider conversation. Which I will not be commenting about at this point. As I really do not know much about the constituents core elements of how that narrative is structured.

Coming back to Oumuamua, it seems like, the jury is still split whether this object should be categorized as an asteroid, a comet, an interplanetary iceberg (that doesn't seem to leave a trail behind or we do not have the finer set of tools to observe the trail), or an [alien probe of sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb#%CA%BBOumuamua).

What piqued my interest was, what seems to my uneducated eyes to be [Oumuamua's strange orbital trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua#/media/File:Comet_20171025-16_gif.gif).
