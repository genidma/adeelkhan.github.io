Last night I was reading up on [2I/Borisov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2I/Borisov). It's the second observed and documented [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) that has passed through our solar system.

[Oumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua) being the first. 

I've spent a little bit more time reading up on Oumuamua, so I will mostly write about this object. As well, the observation of Oumuamua has kickstarted a wider conversation. Which I will not be commenting about at this point. As I really do not know much about the constituents core elements of how that narrative is structured.

Coming back to Oumuamua, it seems like, the jury is still split whether this object should be categorized as an asteroid, a comet, an interplanetary iceberg (that doesn't seem to leave a trail behind or we do not have the finer set of tools to observe the trail), or an [alien probe of sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb#%CA%BBOumuamua).

To my untrained portion of the neocortex and this is what piqued my interest.[Oumuamua's orbital trajectory seems strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua#/media/File:Comet_20171025-16_gif.gif). Also, [the following](https://youtu.be/H62WsztrGi0) via NASA's JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab)


According to the [following video](https://youtu.be/PYxhxUik5PY?t=53), via [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard-missions-present):
>"...(combined) observations showed that Oumuamua to have a small, continuous non-gravitational acceleration. Something besides just the gravity from the Sun and the planets (Saturn particularly) was affecting the trajectory of Oumuamua."

The presenter then talks about a [cometary coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(cometary)) and how there's usually a trail of dust/gas/water vapour that a comet usually leaves behind as a trail. Specifically when the comet is heating up (proximity to sun or I am thinking in the orbit of a larger planet with the gravitational forces exerted upon it[).](https://getproofed.com/writing-tips/punctuate-brackets/#:~:text=Always%20place%20periods%20outside%20closing,the%20end%20of%20a%20clause.)

Let's recap:
* Oumuamua is not from this solar system. 
* It has no coma (cometary tail) and/or the tail cannot be observed (Unlike other comets).
* Oumuamua picks up speed as it passes through our solar system. Interaction with the sun's gravity as well as the gravitional forces of other planet **does not** explain why this object picked up speed. Cannot be said that outgassing is a factor, since (again) there is no coma. 
* Oumuamua is also expected to take a particular trajectory (expected). There is a change in it's trajectory, which cannot be explained. A difference of about 25,000 miles or 40,000 kilometers.
