Hello!

How are you doing?

Hey, I wanted to say that I am so grateful that you decided to drop by! I sincerely do. 

Here at the Awake Group of companies, surely but steadily we've been working towards setting down the foundations for our company. 

Part of our strategy is to operate in a transparent manner. So we made our status reports available for everyone to see. 
* [ASI - Awake Space Industries - Status Reports](https://app.clickup.com/8576617/docs/85qk9-721/85qk9-497)
* [AUH - Awake Universal Healthcare - Status Reports](https://app.clickup.com/8576617/docs/85qk9-728/85qk9-504)
* Note: I wanted to highlight that a significant number of our tasks are available for everyone to review. For example, a number of people have inquired about our Orientation week. So, I simply started making the structure for the training accessible to anyone with the link - Here is a [sample](https://share.clickup.com/t/h/n74gx6/BQI2974VX87HZ6U)(also available via the status reports).
 

As well, including but not limited to the following documents:
* [ASI - Mission and Milestones](https://app.clickup.com/8576617/docs/85qk9-329/85qk9-105)
* [AUH - Mission and Milestones](https://app.clickup.com/8576617/docs/85qk9-315/85qk9-91)
* [What worked well, what could be improved..](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/85qk9-938/1e915b65980fe87)

The longer term goal is to leverage the power of the crowds in order to bring some of the areas that we have identified and more. Right now, we are collecting ideas (across the board) in order to capitalize upon opportunities in the outspace and healthcare arenas. 

If you have an idea or suggestion that you'd like to share with us, then please do let us know! Here is a [link to a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e62FuwbWvoAKEcIQ_1E2l7oesyooBHS-xDL6DNjl7-A/edit?usp=sharing) for this purpose and you should be able to edit it directly. 


Overall, thank you sincerely for your time and for your support. I look forward to sharing updates with our supporters.

Sincerely, 

Adeel Khan
Founder at Awake Group of companies.
