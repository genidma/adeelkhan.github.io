Ever since reading Cal Newport's book by the title of '[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Deep+work+kindle&i=stripbooks&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)', I have not been as active on social media. Not to the same effect. 

From time to time I do take a break. More recently I've shared some of my thoughts on Quora.  

I am almost at the 500 answers mark. Most of my answers are on the topics of:
* Early stage startups and entrepreneurship.
* Innovation as a process and as a discipline. 
* Industries of the future. 
* Some of human psychology. A lot of these answer come down to encouraging the participant to talk to a general practitioner or an evidenced based practitoner in a related domain. (Talk to GP first)

Here is a link to my [profile on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adeel-Khan-3/answers). Maybe there is something on there that could be useful for you. 

Feel free to engage me on Quora and ask me a question that you may have on your mind. A question you believe I could assist you in answering/or help frame another question or series of questions.

Thanks for reading.
